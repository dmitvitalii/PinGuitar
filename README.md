## PROJECT
This is a fork of Tux Guitar. It will be an attempt to redevelop and enhance the application.

**Some goals**:
* Fix a build;
* Move to Gradle;
* Rewrite in Kotlin;
* Redesign the Android application;
* Use TornadoFX (JavaFX) instead of SWT;

Most likely it won't happen, but for studying and the glory of satan ðŸ™ˆ.
